# RNN vs GRU vs Transformer in sentence generation

## Purpose

Android application to keep track of gambling activities for excessive players, and reduce the gambling behavior.

There is a big concern among casino games, lottery, excessive gambling, and with the expansion of online gambling making these activities much more accessible, we can notice a considerable increase of the gambling activities among young players which in the end may result in very positive results for the business, but negatively for the gambler, who may suffer many negative consequences (e.g.,addiction, ruin). The gambling monitoring project consists of developing a smartphone application targeting the gambling activities of young players, notably college students, and giving them the means to control their gambling behavior. Research shows that up to 80% of college students gamble or already have, and a significant number develop gambling-related problems. Hence, if a player develops excessive gambling behavior such as playing for an excessive amount of time or losing an unreasonable amount of money while playing, the application should identify this pattern and notify the player of his behaviours giving him some recommendations where applicable.

The desired goal of this app is to help players monitor their gambling behaviour and perhaps help reduce it if over-involvement in gambling activities has occurred. The application displays the duration of the gambling session, and tracks the amount of money won/lost per session.
