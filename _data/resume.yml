  summary: >
    Machine learning master's student and Canadian track athlete.
    I have been working as a Software Engineer at Ericsson for a few years, and in 2019, I decided to start my master's in Machine Learning. I love sports, 
    and when I am not outside, I am lurking in front of my computer trying to understand why my gradient is stuck in a local minimum.
